### Security Audits
**Protocols Audited:**  
KILT (Substrate DeFi), Gno (Cosmos), Plutus (Cardano DeFi), Hydration DX (Substrate DeFi), Crestal Network(EVM DePin)

Found multiple high and medium severity vulnerabilities across these protocol.

### Open Source

**NautilusTrader**: Ported critical trading systems (Throttler, Risk Engine, Portfolio, Indicators) to Rust for low-latency trading. Built [nautilustrader.io](https://nautilustrader.io) and full [documentation portal](https://nautilustrader.io/docs).

**ARK Builders**: Built file/folder storage system in Rust. Wrote JNI bindings to integrate it with Java/Kotlin apps and implemented custom LRU cache for frequently accessed data.

**JaegerTracing**: Built Jaeger v2 on OpenTelemetry during LFX mentorship. Implemented adaptive sampling for v2 to optimize trace filtering for storage backends.

### Commercial Projects
**Leapwallet (TON DeFi)** : Implemented optimized token swap algorithms with multi-path routing for decentralized exchange.

**Stealth Data Firm** : Built high-performance PostgreSQL proxy server in Rust with semantic query transformation, strict privilege management, and AWS S3 model storage integration.
